<h1 align="center"> Web version of DogStagram</h1>

This is the web version of dogstagram. This would have been unecessary if Expo platform was used. Currently exploring the option of integrating `react native for web` into existing app to replicate web functionality since that is the package that enables Expo to create a web version of the app out of the box. Expo was not used because of the need for finer control of planned functionalities and easier access to more react native APIs
